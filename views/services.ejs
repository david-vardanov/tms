        <h4>Dry Van</h4>
        <p>
          Dry Vans are the most common type of trailer for transporting goods. They are versatile and suitable for a wide range of cargo, providing protection from the elements and security during transit.

        <h4>Reefer</h4>
        <p>
          Refrigerated trailers, or Reefers, are designed to transport temperature-sensitive cargo. Equipped with temperature control systems, Reefers maintain the desired temperature throughout transit, making them perfect for perishable goods such as food, pharmaceuticals, and more.

        <h4>Flatbed</h4>
        <p>
          Flatbed trailers are ideal for transporting oversized or irregularly shaped cargo. With an open and level platform, they provide easy loading and unloading from the sides or top, accommodating construction materials, machinery, vehicles, and more.

        <img src="/img/placeholder.png" alt="Step Deck" class="mb-3">
        <h4>Step Deck</h4>
        <p>
          Step Deck trailers, also known as Drop Deck trailers, feature a lowered deck to accommodate taller cargo. This design allows for the transportation of larger equipment and machinery that would exceed height restrictions on a standard flatbed.

        <img src="/img/placeholder.png" alt="Conestoga" class="mb-3">
        <h4>Conestoga</h4>
        <p>
          Conestoga trailers combine the benefits of a flatbed with the protection of a dry van. They feature a flexible, retractable tarp system that provides easy access to the cargo while offering protection from weather and theft, making them suitable for a variety of shipments.
